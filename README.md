# Drag Est - A quarter mile drag race outcome visualizer 

# Background 

Drag Est lets you select 2 vehicles and shows a winner based on quarter mile times provided by the manufacturer. There will be a small quarter mile drag strip, top view down, in the center of the window and the winning car will be at the finish line and it will show the gap that the losing car lost by. 

There will a wide selection of vehicles varying from sports cars to economy cars. There will be statistics of the vehicle shown on the left and right sides along with a picture of the vehicle. The stats would show year, make, model, horsepower, price, etc. There is a toggle switch in the middle to switch between car 1 and car 2.

# Functionality & MVPs

In Drag Est, users will be able to:

- Select from a selection of popular vehicles to compare quarter mile drag race outcome.
- View the specifications of the selected vehicle.
- View the photograph of the selected vehicle.

In addition, this project will include:

- An About section decribing the background of the website .
- A production README.
